# Federal-Employee-Attrition-Model
This project focused on the Department of Veterans Affairs for the time period of Q3-2016.
By using publicly available information, we were able to create a prediction model using only descriptive information.
Future implementation should include additional subjective and objective variables/features.
As a preliminary model, we have shown that a predicition model can be made on employee attrition.
